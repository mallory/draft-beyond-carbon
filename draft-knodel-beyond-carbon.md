--- abstract

The global internet is comprised of vast interconnected networks spanning nearly every surface of planet and sky that, together with user devices, consumes energy and emits greenhouse gases. The true scale and proposed mitigations of the carbon footprint of the internet are the subject of important research. The internet also requires the depletion of other natural resources beyond carbon, namely land, water, electromagnetic spectrum and minerals. Electronic waste contributes in particularly acute ways to environmental pollution. This document surveys the impacts of the internet on the environment and includes, but goes beyond, energy use and carbon footprint to look at the consumption of natural resources and environmental waste.

# Introduction

This document aims to briefly categorize a complete survey of environmental impacts due to a global internet operating at scale. It is the expectation that these impacts are persistent and some will have few to no mitigations, even given a very long arc of innovation and scientific advancement. That is because each of these impacts are intimately tied to the physical limits of our planet, which are far more finite than our imaginations are capacious.

It is, however, of utmost importance to confront and understand the planet's limitations and the ways in which internet growth pushes up against them.

# The Internet's Environmental Impacts

This section is arranged in three sub-sections: 2.1. Carbon, 2.2. Natural Resources and 2.3. Waste. In the first section, of course carbon is a natural resource but in this document we rely on the vast reserach and documentation elsewhere to discuss the consumption of energy and its emissions in the form of greenhouse gas. Land, water, electromagnitic spectrum and minerals are all finite, non-renewable resources that are consumed by internet infrastructure and these impacts are explained in depth with citations. Lastly waste is discussed as its own very consequential impact on the pollution of the rest of the environment, living and nonliving.

## Carbon 

Carbon footprint -- emissions, global warming, ozone layer.
Energy consumption -- unequal distribution and limitations on use for other purposes.

## Natural resources

### Land

Finite space / limit of use for other humans,
Animals and other ecosystems, too [Vesna]
Disruption of the sea bed

### Water

For cooling,
For mineral extraction,
Limits use for other humans but animals and other ecosystems, too [Vesna]

### Electromagnetic spectrum

Finite resource allocated to large companies and developed countries despite ITU pledge to allocate otherwise.

### Minerals

Extractive of finite resources which minerals,
Use of water,
Effects of scarring and degrading earth crust,
Destroying habitats,
Poisonous at the time of extraction,
Limited use for other things.

## Waste

In the air -- pollution from fossil fuels, burning e-waste
On earth -- sanitation, landfills, polluting soil, limiting use of space, ecosystem disruption
In the sea -- undersea cables, mineral extraction byproducts, e-waste shipping, pollution
In space -- debris, crowding the sky scape, congestion, limit of use

# Conclusions

Particular takeaways to mitigate effects: reduce extraction, efficiency in architecture to reduce cooling, more equitable resource distribution, data localisation impacts, backwards compatibility and protocol maintenance as antidoes to "Green IP".

# Security Considerations

There are no security considerations for this document.

# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.
